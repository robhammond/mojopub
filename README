MojoPub - A simple Mojolicious & MongoDB based CMS.

Barebones CMS with visual page editor - easily themeable with bootstrap-based 
admin & default theme.

MojoPub is intended to be a Perl-based CMS that is:

* easy to use for people who don't know Perl
* easy to install (for people who don't know Perl)
* SEO friendly right out of the box (unlike Wordpress)
* not bug ugly (unlike a lot of Perl-based CMSs out there!)
